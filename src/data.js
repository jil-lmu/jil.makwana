        problem: "The restaurant industry is highly competitive, with a high failure rate for new establishments. Understanding the factors that contribute to restaurant success or failure is crucial for entrepreneurs looking to enter the market.",
        approach: "I used survival analysis techniques to model the time until restaurant failure. I collected data on restaurant characteristics, location, and operating conditions to build a comprehensive dataset. I then used Cox proportional hazards models to identify the factors that influence restaurant survival.",
        solution: "Crime Rate Prediction and Zipcode matters when it comes to opening a new restaurant. I built a model to predict the crime rate in a given zipcode and used it to identify the best locations for opening a new restaurant.",
        impact: "I built a model to predict the crime rate in a given zipcode and used it to identify the best locations for opening a new restaurant. The model was able to predict the crime rate with 80% accuracy."
